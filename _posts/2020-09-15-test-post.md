If you're reading this, then Day 2 has gone pretty dang well! Spent the morning finishing up safety trainings, then after the lab meeting, started working on setting up the lab notebook. Hit some walls - particularly around setting up comments with Disqus - but ended up finding solutions to everything. I'm sure that won't be the case every day, but it's an encouraging start!
