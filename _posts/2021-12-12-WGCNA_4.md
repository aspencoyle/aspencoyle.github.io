Note: If you're trying to follow my work chronologically, this is really more like WGCNA 5 - I did a small recap of some WGCNA work in my December Goals post (the previous one).

Regardless, this post summarizes a few changes I've made to my WGCNA analysis recently. They are as follows:
- Changing _Hematodinium_ qPCR levels
- Adding new analyses to compare **change** in _Hematodinium_ qPCR levels
- Removing irrelevant analyses

# Changing _Hematodinium_ qPCR levels

### Process Description

As part of my WGCNA analysis (again, using signed networks), I wanted to examine _Hematodinium_ levels within the crab. To get a number for this, I took the SQ mean from all runs for that crab. However, qPCR was ran on samples from Day 0 and Day 17, and often the _Hematodinium_ level changed substantially between those two timepoints. Rather than averaging the SQ mean between Days 0 and 17 (if available for that crab), I decided it would be optimal to use **Day 0 SQ mean only** as my WGCNA input. This had two benefits:

- 1: Removes issue of elevated-temperature crab, for which only Day 0 qPCR data is available

- 2: Removes conflation of _Hematodinium_ infection direction. You'd expect a sample with rapidly increasing _Hematodinium_ to have markedly different expression from a sample with markedly decreasing _Hematodinium_, but it's quite possible that this would be covered up by taking the mean.

To preserve previous runs (just in case I wanted to look at them again later), I put them in a subdirectory called "hemat_average")

Prior to re-running WGCNA, I went back and looked at Pam's qbit results. I'm glad I did, because I found an error in my sheet! Not sure where it originated (maybe simple copy-paste error or typo, maybe something in the project sheet I got from grace) despite poking around and trying to find the error in the original, but regardless, for Crab E, the SQ Mean values for Day 0 and Day 17 were reversed! Luckily not an issue for any analyses previously, but definitely good to catch because of the new analyses I'll describe in the next section.

### Results

Again, I ran WGCNA on samples from all crabs on all days. Variables were crab, day, temperature (with pairwise comparisons and vs. all), Hematodinium level _on Day 0_, carapace width, and shell condition. Here's the heatmaps from the complete, Tanner crab, and parasite transcriptomes, respectively:

![Tanner crab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afcoyle/hemat_bairdi_transcriptome/main/output/WGCNA_output/cbai_transcriptomev4.0/all_crabs/day_as_var/ModuleTreatmentHeatMap.png)

As before, I examined module/variable correlation when correlation was <= 0.05. If the correlation appeared to be predominantly due to the effect of a single crab, I discarded it. That left me with the following modules and correlations:

| Transcriptome | Module | Trait(s)                               | p-value(s)    |
|---------------|--------|----------------------------------------|---------------|
| Complete      | yellow | Lowered vs. Elevated, Elevated vs. All | 0.02, 0.03    |
| Complete      | cyan   | Lowered vs. Ambient, Elevated vs. All  | 0.02, 0.04    |
| Complete      | salmon | Lowered vs. Ambient                    | 0.04          |
| Complete      | blue   | day                                    | 0.03          |
| Tanner crab   | black  | Lowered vs. Ambient, Elevated vs. All  | 8x10^-4, 0.05 |
| Tanner crab   | brown  | Lowered vs. Elevated, Elevated vs. All | 0.02, 0.03    |
| Parasite      | brown  | Hematodinium level                     | 0.02          |
| Parasite      | pink   | day                                    | 0.03          |

My next task is to run these back through GO-MWU to see if anything interesting pops out!

# New analysis to compare change in _Hematodinium_ levels

Previously, I treated infection level as a constant. However, we _do_ have two timepoints here - the start and end of the experiment, Days 0 and 17. Therefore, it makes a whole lot of sense to examine change in infection level as a variable! There is a complicating factor. Since all elevated-treatment crabs died before Day 17 of the experiment, we only have qPCR data from a single timepoint. Therefore, **I restricted this analysis to Lowered and Ambient-temp crabs only**. 

Essentially, to calculate change in _Hematodinium_ level, I took the SQ Mean from Day 17, divided it by the SQ Mean from Day 0 for that same crab, and then put it on a log scale. I then added those numbers in as the variable hemat_diff, and ran WGCNA again!

This run of WGCNA included slightly different variables.
- Added hemat_diff, as described above
- Removed hemat_level, since I wanted to examine the _change_ rather than the starting point
- Removed Shell Condition as a variable, since only one crab had a shell condition other than New (and I'm already looking at the effect of each crab individually)
- Dropped pairwise comparisons and vs. all for temperature comparison, since dropping the Elevated group changes it to a pairwise comparison already

Otherwise, pretty much everything about my run setup was the same!

### Results

Naturally, removing Elevated-temperature samples decreased my sample size. Therefore, I ignored correlation between modules and variables other than hemat_diff. After all, I had already looked at them (and more accurately) in my previous run on all samples!

Still, I'll post the heatmaps from the complete, Tanner crab, and parasite transcriptomes, respectively:

![Tanner crab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afcoyle/hemat_bairdi_transcriptome/main/output/WGCNA_output/cbai_transcriptomev4.0/amb_low/hemat_diff_as_var/ModuleTreatmentHeatMap.png)

![Parasite](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afcoyle/hemat_bairdi_transcriptome/main/output/WGCNA_output/hemat_transcriptomev1.6/amb_low/hemat_diff_as_var/ModuleTreatmentHeatMap.png)

After discarding modules linked strongly to individual crab, as described above, this left me with the following modules associated with hemat_diff:

| Transcriptome | Module | p-value |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| Complete      | blue   | 0.02    |
| Tanner crab   | red    | 0.04    |
| Parasite      | green  | 0.05    |

For all, trait is hemat_diff (I ignored any correlation with other traits for reasons described above).

Next step is to run these guys through GO-MWU to see if anything interesting comes out!

# Removing irrelevant analyses

As I was going through my scripts and output folders, I noticed I had a whole bunch of old WGCNA runs. Most of them were outdated or irreparably broken for some reason or another. For instance, I did the following:

- Analyzed only elevated- or ambient-temp crab (sample size of 6-9) when the minimum sample size for WGCNA is ~15

- Tried to perform pairwise comparisons with separate WGCNA runs instead of putting in all samples and letting WGCNA make the pairwise comparisons

- Set hemat_level (SQ mean from qPCR) as high/low rather than using the precise number

- Used an unsigned instead of signed network - signed is typically optimal as described [here](https://peterlangfelder.com/2018/11/25/signed-or-unsigned-which-network-type-is-preferable/)

So yep, just a whole mess of mistakes! I removed irrelevant scripts and their outputs, and renumbered the existing scripts (remember, all of which begin with 5_) to fix this.
