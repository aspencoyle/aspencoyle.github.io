**Tuesday, October 1**

Another productive day! I started off by doing some FISH 250 stuff and updating some of the class sheets. After that, I moved on to my AFS chapter - I got my last set of edits back, so spent a good portion of the day chatting about that, reflecting on the edits, and updating the chapter accordingly. 

After that, time to move on to the modeling paper! Last time, I rewrote the whole abstract and intro. That meant it was time to move on to the methods! I did a bunch of work on the various comments in the methods, along with clearing up a number of the relatively quick and easy edits in the results and discussion. After that, I started tackling the bigger stuff. First on the list: remake my first figure. It really needs a total redo - the mapping package I used when I originally created it is just totally inadequate, and doesn't have the level of detail necessary. I decided to switch over to ggmap, following [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k8O-Y_uiRU). However, in order to do so, I needed to install a ton of R packages - after all, I'm working off a fresh Linux install! Kept getting error after error, as I was missing a whole bunch of compilers. Had a bit of a cycle for a while - get an error installing the R package, go install the compiler, successfully install the package, get an error installing the next R package. 

I also got around to migrating my blog over from the Bittercrab Wordpress site to Substack. The Bittercrab site felt, unsurprisingly, very tied to bitter crab research, and I'm wanting to write about a wider array of topics. I came up with the name Aligned Reads, which I'm very proud of. Anyways, I spent a good chunk of time copying over my old blog posts, setting up the site, et cetera!

Goals for tomorrow:
- Continue rewriting modeling paper with Chelsea's edits
- Set up Element for communication
- Start reading thru Linux book
- Read through AFS chapter one more time
- Send in AFS chapter
- Look into getting First Aid cert
