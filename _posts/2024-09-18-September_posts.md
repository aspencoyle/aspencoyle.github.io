**Wednesday, September 18**

Alright, new schoolyear, new me, new notebook post! It's approaching 9pm so I'll keep this one brief and give a more in-depth summary tomorrow. Today was spent on a variety of UW tasks. 
- Applied to a DEI job in the College of the Environment
- Wrote a blurb for the oSTEM conference I'm heading to (more on that later)
- Updated and reformatted my CV
- Did some troubleshooting on my website
- Did some UW Trans Community stuff
- Applied for a FINS grant

That's all for today, I'm headed home to sleep! More to come tomorrow

**Thursday, September 19**

Alright, accomplished quite a bit again! This time, it all focused on the chapter I'm writing. A bit more about that:

I was approached a month or so ago by some people at the American Fisheries Society to write a chapter for a book on being a woman/gender minority in fishery sciences. Obviously this is something I'm pretty passionate about communicating, as frankly I don't think most cis people have a very accurate understanding of what it's like to be transfemme - the sorts of hardships faced, etc. 

I've been working on it for a while, and today I got to a first draft that I'm legitimately quite proud of. I'll send it off to some close pals for edits and reviews, and then I'll send it along to the folks over at AFS! It certainly doesn't focus much on fisheries and centers a lot more on the general hardships of being trans. But honestly, I think that's pretty important for scientists to understand!

Also, some additional updates on the oSTEM (Out in STEM) conference I mentioned yesterday. I've got a pretty decent level of familiarity with oSTEM - Matthew (my ex) ran his college oSTEM club - and they seem to do a lot of good stuff. Anyways, they're having their big conference this year over in Portland, OR and I got asked to be on the Gender Panel. Me and like three other people, with a mix of pre-written questions and questions from the audience. I'll also get to lead some breakout groups and set whatever discussion I want! I've already done most of the logistical work for the conference. Remaining tasks: reflect on pre-written questions and plan the breakout group topics. 

Anyways, I'll be heading down there from Oct. 18-20. I also got entry for Jo, which I'm really excited about!!
