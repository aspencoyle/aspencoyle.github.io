**Success?**

It looks like things went pretty dang well! Finished the tutorial, and essentially completed my next task - locally blasting hematodinium sequences against the Swiss-prot protein database. 

Things went fairly smoothly overall - much of the day was spent waiting for the blast to finish!

One significant question that still remains - it sounds like the code I ran only pulls the first result that matches well enough, not necessarily the best match for each query. I'm going to re-run blast, but adding in a line for max_hsps. 

It's really late, so I'll come back to this, but planning to find a way to link the initial results directly into here. **Update, 9/21 - results are linked in the next notebook post (9/21)!**

Happy weekend!
