**Sunday, December 11**

More presentation work!! Think I've finished the presentation, just in time for my practice presentation tomorrow!!

Also graded almost all of Lab 9 (missing one that I gave an extension on). I'll get to that Monday or Tuesday, and then I'm almost done with all TA work!!

**Monday, December 2nd**

Alright, time for monthly goal-setting! This one should be pretty straightforward. Not easy, but straightforward.

Goal #1: Finish Masters presentation. I'm doing a practice presentation for the lab in a few hours. Feeling decent about the slides, but haven't practiced the full presentation at all! 
Hoping to get some quality feedback there.

Goal #2: Update thesis with edits and submit! I've already got the un-updated version formatted correctly, so while the updating will take some time, it shouldn't be tricky.

Goal #3: GRADUATE!!!!!!

Beyond that, I've just got some TA work to finish up. Nothing too tricky, but is as follows:
- Finish grading Lab 9 (one paper left, I gave an extension and she hasn't submitted yet)
- Grade Lab 10 (should be done in class on Thursday)
- Go through old labs to make sure all late assignments got graded

Goals: 
    - Finish grading Lab 09
    - Edit thesis presentation
    - Continue reading Linux book
