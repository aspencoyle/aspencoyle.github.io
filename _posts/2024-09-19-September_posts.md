**Wednesday, September 19**

Alright, new schoolyear, new me, new notebook post! It's approaching 9pm so I'll keep this one brief and give a more in-depth summary tomorrow. Today was spent on a variety of UW tasks. 
- Applied to a DEI job in the College of the Environment
- Wrote a blurb for the oSTEM conference I'm heading to (more on that later)
- Updated and reformatted my CV
- Did some troubleshooting on my website
- Did some UW Trans Community stuff
- Applied for a FINS grant

That's all for today, I'm headed home to sleep! More to come tomorrow
