**Thanksgiving Update: 2022-11-23**

Alright, it's been quite a while since I've posted, so it's definitely time for an update (apologies for the delay)!

Big news: Got my paper submitted (the one examining gene expression in _C. bairdi_ and _Hematodinium_)! Hopefully will hear back soon, but glad the bulk of it is over!

Other updates: Have begun working on a paper on the modeling work I've been doing! Finished up the Methods section (well almost, just need to confirm my methods are sound), and have been moving on to the Results. Next goal is to produce some pretty figures for that! One big obstacle to getting there is saving the model results - I ran all four models once and the results sure look saved just fine, but to confirm I'm using the correct read-in function, I need to run the model again so I can have a before/after of reading the model back in. Takes a bit of time, but shouldn't be too much. Once I do that, it's time to start making those figures and writing up the results more thoroughly. 

Since I haven't decided fully whether I should be using model weighting or an optimal model (that's the confirmation of method soundness I mentioned earlier), I'll just write the results up now as my model weighting results. If I need to switch over to an optimal model later, that shouldn't be too hard to do. 

Cheers to feeling better and writing more journal entries!
