**Friday, November 1**

Had a very happy Halloween! Today, I finished up my Aligned Reads post on oSTEM and scheduled it for publication tomorrow morning. 

I also created a prelim invite list for my eventual thesis presentation (once that gets scheduled)!

Goals: 
    - Schedule committee meeting (waiting to hear back from Chelsea)
    - Continue reading Linux book
    - Grade FISH 250 Lab 05
    - Prep for Lab 07

**Monday, November 4**

Meetings all day today. Really enjoyed Grace's presentation during lab meeting, sea stars (and her research) are so neat. Did a bit of grading for Lab 05 too!

Also chatted with Libby about jobs, got some good advice and leads!
