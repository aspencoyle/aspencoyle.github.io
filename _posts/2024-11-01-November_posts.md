**Friday, November 1**

Had a very happy Halloween! Today, I finished up my Aligned Reads post on oSTEM and scheduled it for publication tomorrow morning. 

I also created a prelim invite list for my eventual thesis presentation (once that gets scheduled)!

**Monday, November 4**

Meetings all day today. Really enjoyed Grace's presentation during lab meeting, sea stars (and her research) are so neat. Did a bit of grading for Lab 05 too!

Also chatted with Libby about jobs, got some good advice and leads!

**Thursday, November 7**

Well, there certainly are weeks when decades happen, huh? Or, to move from the political analogy to the biological, the equilibrium certainly is punctuated from time to time, huh?

Feeling not great. Some bat-wielding transphobes apparently have been driving around Cap Hill attacking trans people. 
Some friends got attacked on their way home from karaoke. Things suck sometimes.

But even in the deterioration and hate, there's science to be done. Got basically nothing done Tuesday or Wednesday, but taught labs today and did grading. Fully finished Lab 05

**Friday, November 8**

Spent most of the day at SeaGL (a conference up at the HUB for GNU/Linux and FOSS in general!). Fun times, good chats, shoutout /dev/hack

In my free time, graded all of Lab 06. Yep, the one that was turned in yesterday! Go me

**Monday, November 11**

Veteran's Day, so a nice day off! Still, had an interview with an ecological consulting firm. Enjoyed chatting with them, fingers crossed they've got a position here in Seattle!

**Tuesday, November 12**

Had Rosalind's class from Maritime High come through and get a tour of the lab. Holy moly, high schoolers are a handful!

Also looked into a few options for scheduling my thesis presentation. Looks like it'll be the second week of December!

Finally, continued reading the Linux book I've been going through. 

**Friday, November 15**

Took a few days off - had a minor medical procedure on Wednesday, and was in a whole lot of pain Thursday! Feeling fine now though, so back at it!

Scheduled my thesis presentation (Tuesday, Dec. 10th at 1pm!!!). Gotta start putting together slides, letting people know, etc!

Put some trans people in touch with SAFS Admin re: moving to Seattle. Glad I'm able to help people out, hate that they need the help.

Also got Chelsea's edits back!! Starting work on them ASAP. I already edited Figure 1 of the methods paper and addressed almost all the text edits, but still want 
to get some work done on it over the weekend. We'll see!

**Monday, November 18**

It's Monday, so it's meeting day! FISH 250 meeting, lab meeting, office hours, doctor's appointment. But in my spare time, I did a bunch of grading (half of the stuff for Testing Taxis lab!)

I also got some important info on the thesis presentation - I should prep for about 50 minutes of presenting, and then however long it takes for Q+A. I also started sending out invites!

Tomorrow is three weeks until my presentation!!!

**Tuesday, November 19**

Three weeks until my presentation!!!!!

I decided to knock out grading for 250 - work ahead so I can really put my nose to the grindstone in the last few weeks without other distractions. Plus I'm filling in for Celeste on Friday,
so working ahead is nice. Anyways, I graded the second half of the Testing Taxis labs and got about half of Lab 8 completed as well!

**Wednesday, November 20**

Sat in on the interagency Alaska crab meeting (thanks, Madi!), which went all day today! Saw a ton of cool work done - particularly loved hearing about Leah Zacher's work on Bristol Bay RKC 
tagging efforts (really made me appreciate the utility of PSATs on crabs, something I've always been a bit skeptical of), along with Erin Fedewa's work on snow crab energetics 
- the hepatopancreas wet weight:dry weight ratio being predictive of total fatty acid ratio and thus of overall crab health was FASCINATING, and it really feels like there's 
some neat projects to be done there. Also loved seeing Andy present the good ol' PSAT vs. acoustic work from my Kodiak days!!

Additionally, finished grading all of the Polar Seas lab and addressed almost all of Chelsea's edits! I've just got one more to do - create graphs.
This'll be a tricky one, as there's some questions on how to structure those graphs in a way that makes sense. Initial thoughts: choose the four most pronounced effects for each model,
put em in a panel.

I already made one for the percent of crabs with BCS at each shell condition! Good start, but more to do! Definitely need CW and sex, probably some female- and male-specific ones too

**Thursday, November 21**

No progress today - unsurprisingly, it was a double lab day! Started setting up lab at 8am, didn't get done till 5pm. Busy busy day. 

**Friday, November 22**

Filled in for Celeste's lab this afternoon, but got a bunch of stuff done! Almost done addressing Chelsea's edits, just a bit more to go. 

Made some extremely pretty visualizations between the raw data and all variables for the four variables with the greatest coefficients in the general model (SC, CW sex, Black Mat)
along with all sex-specific variables in their models (egg dev, maturity, egg pct). 

Should likely add other significant variables to general model graph (depth, temp), and need to write a caption for the new Figure 5 (sex-specific variables graphed vs raw data)

**Monday, November 25**

Meeting day again! Got a bunch of stuff done too. Worked on analysis of why I'm seeing highest rates of BCS at mid clutch fullness (there's way fewer infected crabs w/ low CF), which seems to
indicate it impacts fecundity

Also graded a bunch of stuff for FISH 250!!

**Tuesday, November 26**

- Fixed up some of the captions (egg percent -> clutch fullness)
- Wrote up analysis of why we're seeing highest rates at mid clutch fullness


**Friday, November 29**

Took Wednesday and Thursday off for Thanksgiving, but we're in full thesis finishing mode now!!

- Finished up caption of Figure 5
- Redid figure numbering in scripts
- Wrote up analysis of why we're seeing highest rates at mid clutch fullness
- Finished inviting people to presentation!

**Saturday, November 30**

Coming in all day today to work on presentation! It's going well so far - ahead of schedule, which is nice!

**Sunday, November 31**

More presentation work!! Think I've finished the presentation, just in time for my practice presentation tomorrow!!

Also graded almost all of Lab 9 (missing one that I gave an extension on). I'll get to that Monday or Tuesday, and then I'm almost done with all TA work!!





Goals: 
    - Finish grading Lab 09
    - Edit thesis presentation
    - Continue reading Linux book
