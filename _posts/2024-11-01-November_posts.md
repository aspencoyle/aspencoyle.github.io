**Friday, November 1**

Had a very happy Halloween! Today, I finished up my Aligned Reads post on oSTEM and scheduled it for publication tomorrow morning. 

I also created a prelim invite list for my eventual thesis presentation (once that gets scheduled)!

**Monday, November 4**

Meetings all day today. Really enjoyed Grace's presentation during lab meeting, sea stars (and her research) are so neat. Did a bit of grading for Lab 05 too!

Also chatted with Libby about jobs, got some good advice and leads!

**Thursday, November 7**

Well, there certainly are weeks when decades happen, huh? Or, to move from the political analogy to the biological, the equilibrium certainly is punctuated from time to time, huh?

Feeling not great. Some bat-wielding transphobes apparently have been driving around Cap Hill attacking trans people. 
Some friends got attacked on their way home from karaoke. Things suck sometimes.

But even in the deterioration and hate, there's science to be done. Got basically nothing done Tuesday or Wednesday, but taught labs today and did grading. Fully finished Lab 05

**Friday, November 8**

Spent most of the day at SeaGL (a conference up at the HUB for GNU/Linux and FOSS in general!). Fun times, good chats, shoutout /dev/hack

In my free time, graded all of Lab 06. Yep, the one that was turned in yesterday! Go me

**Monday, November 11**

Veteran's Day, so a nice day off! Still, had an interview with an ecological consulting firm. Enjoyed chatting with them, fingers crossed they've got a position here in Seattle!

**Tuesday, November 12**

Had Rosalind's class from Maritime High come through and get a tour of the lab. Holy moly, high schoolers are a handful!

Also looked into a few options for scheduling my thesis presentation. Looks like it'll be the second week of December!

Finally, continued reading the Linux book I've been going through. 

**Friday, November 15**

Took a few days off - had a minor medical procedure on Wednesday, and was in a whole lot of pain Thursday! Feeling fine now though, so back at it!

Scheduled my thesis presentation (Tuesday, Dec. 10th at 1pm!!!). Gotta start putting together slides, letting people know, etc!

Put some trans people in touch with SAFS Admin re: moving to Seattle. Glad I'm able to help people out, hate that they need the help.

Also got Chelsea's edits back!! Starting work on them ASAP. I already edited Figure 1 of the methods paper and addressed almost all the text edits, but still want 
to get some work done on it over the weekend. We'll see!

Goals: 
    - Invite people to thesis presentation!!!
    - Make thesis presentation!!!
    - Address Chelsea's edits!
    - Continue reading Linux book
    - Grade FISH 250 Lab 06
