**Friday, November 1**

Had a very happy Halloween! Today, I finished up my Aligned Reads post on oSTEM and scheduled it for publication tomorrow morning. 

I also created a prelim invite list for my eventual thesis presentation (once that gets scheduled)!

**Monday, November 4**

Meetings all day today. Really enjoyed Grace's presentation during lab meeting, sea stars (and her research) are so neat. Did a bit of grading for Lab 05 too!

Also chatted with Libby about jobs, got some good advice and leads!

**Thursday, November 7**

Well, there certainly are weeks when decades happen, huh? Or, to move from the political analogy to the biological, the equilibrium certainly is punctuated from time to time, huh?

Feeling not great. Some bat-wielding transphobes apparently have been driving around Cap Hill attacking trans people. 
Some friends got attacked on their way home from karaoke. Things suck sometimes.

But even in the deterioration and hate, there's science to be done. Got basically nothing done Tuesday or Wednesday, but taught labs today and did grading. Fully finished Lab 05

**Friday, November 8**

Spent most of the day at SeaGL (a conference up at the HUB for GNU/Linux and FOSS in general!). Fun times, good chats, shoutout /dev/hack

In my free time, graded all of Lab 06. Yep, the one that was turned in yesterday! Go me

**Monday, November 11**

Veteran's Day, so a nice day off! Still, had an interview with an ecological consulting firm. Enjoyed chatting with them, fingers crossed they've got a position here in Seattle!



Goals: 
    - Schedule committee meeting (waiting to hear back from Chelsea)
    - Continue reading Linux book
    - Grade FISH 250 Lab 06
