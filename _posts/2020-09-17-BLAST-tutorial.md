**Ubuntu...it's hard, folks!**

After chatting with Steven this morning, jumped right into some introductory work - blasting a hematodinium transcriptome. Well, sort of jumped in - started off with a simpler blast tutorial!

Definitely had some difficulties, largely revolving around using Ubuntu. This was my first time using Ubuntu, which led to some frustrating hours. Lesson for the future - instead of starting off on the tutorial, it would've been smart to spend a few hours on Ubuntu 101. Specifically, figuring out how the Windows and WSL directories differ!

But overall, managed to get almost completely through the tutorial. More importantly (and encouragingly!), feel like I know a lot more at the end of the day than I did at the start!

Goal for tomorrow: finish up the tutorial and get started on the actual work!
