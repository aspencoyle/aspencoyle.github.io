### My Background

Before joining the Roberts lab, I was with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game in Kodiak, Alaska. While there, I worked on a variety of crab projects, including crab fecundity studies, fishery sampling, and surveys of the St. Matthew Island blue king crab population. I also branched out beyond crab, doing work on groundfish and various invertebrates, and spent a summer supervising a remote salmon weir on Afognak Island.

During my time in undergrad, I researched genetic links to thermal tolerance in the invasive European greeb crab (*Carcinus maenas*). In my examination of the East Coast population of this globally-distributed invader, I found a link between mitochondrial haplotype and cold tolerance, one of the first linkages between mitochondrial genes and thermal tolerance in any crustacean. 

### My Identity

I'm transfemme, and started transitioning while in grad school. It's absolutely been the best decision of my life, and I feel immeasurably happier and more complete. I'm also extremely passionate about trans solidarity, and nearly always glad to chat about being trans with anyone who's interested! Feel especially free to reach out if you're also trans. There's not many of us in academia, and I really do take that trans solidarity stuff seriously.

### Even More About Aspen

I'm an absolute sucker for karaoke, and I'm starting to figure out more about the strategy of pinball (Seattle has one of the best pinball scenes in the country!).
As a trans woman, I'm also obligated to enjoy weird loud music, so I go to a lot of local concerts and raves. I've also spent a lot of time doing long-distance bike trips, and 
recently have gotten quite into chess. Finally, I've spent the past few years learning Spanish, and am working towards full fluency!
